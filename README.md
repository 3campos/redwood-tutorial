# Redwood Tutorial App

This repo represents the final state of the app created during the [Redwood Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial).
It is meant to be a starting point for those working on the [Tutorial Part 2](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial2).

This repo contains much more styling than the one we built together in the tutorial, but is functionally identical.
